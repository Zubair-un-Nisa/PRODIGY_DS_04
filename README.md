# PRODIGY_DS_04
**Task-04
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.**
 In the first step of data analysis and visualization, I import various libraries such as 'pandas' for data manipulation and 'matplotlib' for visualization, to perform tasks efficiently because libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for data manipulation and visualization.
In the second step, I uploaded datasets into the analysis environment. Because uploading datasets provides the raw material for analysis.
In the third step, I understand the characteristics of the dataset. I explore the basic information about the data such as reviewing the first few rows of the dataset, obtaining summary statistics, and checking data types are preliminary steps in understanding your data.

In the fifth step, train the model
In the last step, check the Accuracy and prediction of the model
